        * **Deployment:** Cloud-based or on-device inference.
    * **Form Analysis Node:**
        * **Technology:** Custom logic (e.g., Python) to compare estimated pose with ideal form.
        * **Data:** Database or knowledge base of ideal exercise forms.
    * **Feedback Generation Node:**
        * **Technology:** LangChain with an LLM to generate corrective feedback.
        * **Logic:**  Translate form deviations into clear and actionable feedback.
* **Workflow Orchestration:**
    * **Technology:** LangGraph to manage the flow of video data and analysis results.
    * **Logic:**  Video upload → pose estimation → form analysis → feedback generation.

**4. Multi-Agent Motivational System**

* **Components:**
    * **Progress Tracking Node:**
        * **Technology:** Backend service to track workout completion, goals achieved, and other progress metrics.
