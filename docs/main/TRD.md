## Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

**1. Introduction**

* **Product Name:** (To be determined)
* **Purpose:** This document outlines the technical requirements for building an AI-powered fitness application.
* **Target Audience:**  Development team, technical stakeholders.

**2. System Architecture**

* **Overall Architecture:** Client-server architecture with web and mobile frontends and a cloud-based backend.
* **Frontend:** 
    * Web: Svelte (primary development focus)
    * Mobile: Flutter (to be developed in phase 2)
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python web framework).
* **Database & Auth:** Supabase (provides PostgreSQL database, authentication, and storage).
* **AI/ML:**
    * LangChain for interacting with LLMs and managing workflows.
    * Large Language Model (LLM): Gemini Pro (for workout generation, feedback, nutrition planning, motivational messages, content recommendations).
    * Computer Vision: MediaPipe (for pose estimation in exercise form analysis).

**3. Frontend**

* **Technology:** 
    * Web: Svelte
    * Mobile: Flutter (Phase 2)
* **Responsibilities:**
    * User interface (UI) design and implementation
    * User input handling and validation
    * Data display and visualization
    * Communication with the backend API
    * (Optional) On-device processing for certain features (e.g., initial pose estimation)
* **Considerations:**
    * Responsive web design for various screen sizes
    * Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
    * Mobile-first approach for web development
    * Offline functionality for workout tracking and content access
    * Performance optimization for smooth user experience
    * Cross-platform compatibility for mobile development

**4. Backend**

* **Technology:** FastAPI (Python).
* **Responsibilities:**
    * API endpoint development (RESTful API).
    * Business logic implementation.
    * Data processing and validation.
    * Communication with the database (Supabase).
    * Integration with AI/ML models (LangChain, LLMs, computer vision).
    * Authentication and authorization (using Supabase Auth).
* **Considerations:**
    * API security (authentication, authorization, input validation).
    * Scalability to handle increasing user load.
    * Error handling and logging.

**5. Database & Authentication**

* **Technology:** Supabase.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL.
* **Schema:**
    * **Users:**  user_id, email, password, name, age, gender, fitness_goals, preferences, workout_history, nutrition_data, etc.
    * **Workouts:** workout_id, user_id, date, exercises, sets, reps, weight, feedback, etc.
    * **Exercises:** exercise_id, name, description, muscle_group, equipment, difficulty, instructions, video_url, etc.
    * **Nutrition:**  food_logs, meal_plans, recipes, etc.
    * **Content:** article_id, title, content, category, etc.
* **Authentication:**
    * Utilize Supabase Auth for user management, authentication, and authorization.
    * Implement secure token-based authentication for API access.

**6. AI/ML Integration**

* **LangChain:**
    * Use LangChain to manage prompts, chain LLMs, connect to tools (like Python REPL for calculations), and access external APIs.
    * Define and manage different chains for workout generation, feedback, nutrition planning, and content recommendations.
* **LLM (Gemini Pro):**
    * Fine-tune the LLM for fitness-specific language and tasks.
    * Implement prompt engineering techniques to optimize LLM outputs.
* **Computer Vision (MediaPipe):**
    * Integrate MediaPipe for pose estimation in exercise form analysis.
    * Process video frames from the frontend and extract body landmarks.
    * Compare estimated pose with ideal form data to provide feedback.

**7. API Design**

* **RESTful API:** Design a clear and consistent RESTful API for communication between the frontend and backend.
* **Endpoints:**
    * `/users`:  For user management (registration, login, profile updates).
    * `/workouts`:  For workout plans, exercise data, workout logging, form analysis.
    * `/nutrition`:  For food logging, meal plans, recipe recommendations.
    * `/content`:  For accessing and recommending educational content.
* **Data Format:** JSON for data exchange.

**8. Deployment**

* **Frontend:**  
    * Web: Deploy to cloud hosting (Vercel/Netlify)
    * Mobile: Deploy to respective app stores (iOS App Store, Google Play Store) in Phase 2
* **Backend:**  Deploy to a cloud platform (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) using containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes).
* **Database:**  Utilize Supabase's managed database service.

**9. Testing and Monitoring**

* **Unit Testing:**  Test individual components and functions.
* **Integration Testing:**  Test interactions between different modules.
* **End-to-End Testing:**  Test the entire application flow.
* **Performance Testing:**  Ensure the app performs well under different loads.
* **Security Testing:**  Identify and address security vulnerabilities.
* **Monitoring:**  Implement logging and monitoring tools to track app performance, errors, and user behavior.

**10. Development Tools**

* **IDE:**  VS Code, PyCharm.
* **Version Control:** Git.
* **Project Management:** Jira, Trello.
* **CI/CD:**  GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.
